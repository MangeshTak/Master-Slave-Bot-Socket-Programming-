// let all slaves connect to www.sjsu.edu, each slave creats 1 connection.
connect all www.sjsu.edu 80 

// let all slaves connect to www.sjsu.edu, each slave creats 2 connection.
connect all www.sjsu.edu 80 2 

// let all slaves disconnect with www.sjsu.edu with port 80
disconnect all www.sjsu.edu 80 

// let all slaves disconnect with www.sjsu.edu with all ports
disconnect all www.sjsu.edu 

connect 127.0.0.1 www.google.com 80 5
connect all www.google.com 80 5

// add keepalive option
connect all www.sjsu.edu 80 keepalive

connect all www.google.com 80 url=/#q=
connect all www.google.com 80 10 url=/#q=
connect all www.google.com 80 10 keepalive url=/#q=

// let all slaves test a range of IPs (by using ICMP echo)
ipscan all 4.2.2.2-4.2.2.8 

// let specific slaves test a range of IPs (by using ICMP echo)
